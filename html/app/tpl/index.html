                    <p>
                        Startup Garage x WeWork pre-accelerator is a new kind of startup programme specifically designed for non-technical founders that are serious about transforming ideas into investment-ready ventures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Candidates are carefully selected through an online application programme. Successful applicants enter a 3-month pre-acceleration process, during which Startup Garage builds them a prototype and provides a dedicated technical team for unlimited product iteration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also work intensively with applicants to meet investors’ expectations. After three months, we provide them an opportunity to raise seed investment or move onwards to an accelerator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a paid programme. We do not take equity. We accept applications on a rolling basis.
                    </p>

                                    During the first week, Starters will focus on figuring out what product features are relevant to investors and work with a dedicated technical team to come up with the direction of your prototyping plan. This will serve as the blueprint for developing a Minimal Viable Product (“MVP”). Familiarizing oneself with the team and articulating a clear direction during this week will lead to more seamless cooperation in the next stage.

                                    During Week 2-­5, Starters shall be aiming to complete a first turn of your MVP. Startup Garage’s product­to­market approach emphasizes quick development of an MVP designed with basic features that will appeal to a small target audience. The technical team we provide is aimed to deliver you fast prototyping within this time frame of one month, working with you based on your needs and scheduling. Startup Garage team’s technical range is vast; we can build a full spectrum of web­based, iOS and Android apps. During this stage, you will also have an opportunity to informally meet our mentors and experts to share your concepts.

                                    By week 6, you will be entrenched in the programme, with a prototype 1.0 and having access to our community of people dedicated to help you succeed. You will then continue to experiment by tweaking your product, see how the market responds, and alter your offering accordingly. The goal is to accelerate the pace of designing a product and developing a market. </p>

                                    Making repeated prototypes quickly, is how you approach entrepreneurialism in any sort of scientific manner. Nothing needs to scale, or work at the edge ­cases, until it has product­ market fit; and you might need to ship three or five or ten or twenty different iterations until you find one that works. </p>

                                <p>
                                    Startup is about searching for a business model by building MVP after MVP, as quickly as possible. MVPs don’t need to be able to scale. They just need to prove product ­market fit. Once you've got your traction, your proof, your intent ­to­ buy, you can use that to get the loans or capital, to build the well ­engineered version. Until then, "engineering" is not even a consideration.

                                    In these three months, Startup Garage provides you a conducive environment to “accelerate” your startup. These 90 days are crucial to get lift off for your business, and you are able to fully focus without distraction on your idea.
                                    <p>
                                        At the end of the programme, you will have transformed your idea into a market­tested prototype. This should sufficiently equip Starters to pitch to investors and accelerators. We hope you will take full flight through two potential channels we have for our Starters who have completed our 3­month programme:
                                    </p>
                                      <span>  1.) Access to capital via angel investors or seed funding</span>

                                        That’s generally how your three months will be. It will be intense, but we are focused on making your ideas a reality and delivering results. </p>

                        Startup’s product-to-market approach emphasizes on quick development of a “minimum viable product,” designed with the smallest set of features that will appeal to a small group of target audience. You will then continue to experiment by tweaking your offerings, see how the market responds, and change your offerings accordingly. The goal is to accelerate the pace of designing a product and developing a market.
