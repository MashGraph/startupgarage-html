            Pre-Accelator for Non-Technical Founders
          </h2>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Startup Garage x WeWork pre-accelerator is a new kind of startup programme specifically designed for non-technical founders that are serious about transforming ideas into investment-ready ventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Candidates are carefully selected through an online application programme. Successful applicants enter a 3-month pre-acceleration process, during which Startup Garage builds them a prototype and provides a dedicated technical team for unlimited product iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also work intensively with applicants to meet investors’ expectations. After three months, we provide them an opportunity to raise seed investment or move onwards to an accelerator.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a paid programme. We do not take equity. We accept applications on a rolling basis.
          </p>

              Startup’s product-to-market approach emphasizes on quick development of a “minimum viable product,” designed with the smallest set of features that will appeal to a small group of target audience. You will then continue to experiment by tweaking your offerings, see how the market responds, and change your offerings accordingly. The goal is to accelerate the pace of designing a product and developing a market.
